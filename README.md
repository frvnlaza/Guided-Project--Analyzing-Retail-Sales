In this project, we'll take on the role of an analyst for a chain of retail stores. 
The chief financial officer has tasked us with creating a study that explores the chain's sales performance over the past few years across all categories.
We'll start by exploring the available data, then we'll perform a series of analyses to look at sales, profitability, and other metrics by segment and over time.
